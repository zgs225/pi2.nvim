# Attention & dialogs

Extensions can ask the user for input mid-turn — selects, confirms, free-form text, multi-line editors, and the [diff review](diff-review.md) are all different flavors of the same thing under the hood: an `extension_ui_request` that blocks the agent until the user responds. pi2.nvim calls these **attention requests**, and they share a single queue and UI surface.

## Immediate vs queued

When a request arrives, pi2.nvim decides between showing it immediately and queueing it:

- **Immediate** — if the current tab's π prompt is focused _and_ has no draft text, the request is dispatched right away. This is the common case while you're actively working with the agent: confirmations, selects, and diffs just pop up as soon as they're needed.
- **Queued** — otherwise (you're editing another file, you have draft text in the prompt, you're in a different tab, or the session is running detached in the background while viewing a sub-session), the request is added to a per-session queue, an attention indicator lights up in the statusline, and a notification appears so you don't lose track of it. The agent stays blocked on that request regardless. Requests for detached background sessions survive tab detachment as long as their backend process is running.

Queued requests can be opened on demand with:

- `:PiAttention` — open the oldest queued request across all tabs, switching to its tab if attached.
- `pi.attention()` — same thing from Lua.

Both are no-ops when there's nothing queued.

## Auto-open on prompt focus

By default (`attention.auto_open_on_prompt_focus = true`), simply focusing the π prompt with an empty draft pulls the next queued request for the current tab automatically. This matches the mental model of "the prompt is the place where the agent talks to you" — when you show up at the prompt ready to interact, π dispatches whatever's pending.

Disable this if you prefer to control the timing manually:

```lua
require("pi").setup({
    attention = {
        auto_open_on_prompt_focus = false,
    },
})
```

With auto-open disabled, you drain the queue explicitly with `:PiAttention`.

## Completion notification

`attention.notify_on_completion` (default `true`) shows an info notification when the agent finishes a turn **and you are not already looking at π**:

> Agent finished - waiting for your input

It does **not** fire when:

- history is being replayed (parent ↔ sub-session switch, compaction rebuild, `:PiTree` reload, resume)
- this tab's chat has focus (history, prompt, or attachments)
- the `:PiSessions` list has focus

Handy if you are working on something else — another buffer, or another agent in a neighbor tab — and want a heads-up when this one is done. Disable with `attention.notify_on_completion = false`.

## Querying the queue

A few Lua functions let you inspect the attention state without opening anything — useful for custom statuslines, tabline indicators, or extension widgets:

```lua
local pi = require("pi")

pi.attention_count()         -- pending requests for the current tab
pi.attention_count(tab_id)   -- pending requests for a specific tab
pi.attention_total()         -- pending requests across all tabs
pi.has_attention()           -- boolean shortcut for the current tab
pi.attention_state()         -- full state snapshot
```

pi2.nvim also fires a `User` autocmd when a new request is added to the queue:

```lua
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("User", {
    pattern = "PiAttentionRequested",
    callback = function(event)
        local data = event.data
        -- data.tab (nil for detached background sessions), data.kind ("diff"|"select"|"confirm"|"input"|"editor"),
        -- data.tab_count, data.total_count
    end,
})
```

The built-in `attention` statusline component already uses this state — see [Statusline](usage.md#statusline) for its icon/counter options.

## Dialog UI

Selects and confirms render through `vim.ui.select`, so they appear in whatever picker you have configured (telescope's `ui-select` extension, snacks.nvim, the built-in picker, …). Every call passes a stable `kind` — `pi-thinking-level`, `pi-model`, `pi-resume-session`, `pi-diff-note`, `pi-extension-select`, `pi-confirm`, or plain `pi-select` — which picker backends can use for per-source customization. Inputs and editors are custom floating windows with the `pi-dialog` filetype. Style and keys for the floats live under `dialog` in `setup()`:

```lua
require("pi").setup({
    dialog = {
        border = "rounded",
        -- Max size: fraction (<1) of editor, or columns/lines (>=1).
        max_width = 0.8,
        max_height = 0.8,
        keys = {
            -- Additional keys, on top of the built-in defaults below.
            -- See the Key specs section for the format.
            confirm = { { "<C-CR>", modes = { "n", "i" } } },
            cancel = nil,
        },
    },
})
```

Input and info dialogs come with a base set of keybindings; `dialog.keys` adds to them rather than replacing them:

| Action | Built-in keys | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `confirm` | `<CR>` (normal + insert) | Submit the value / close the info dialog |
| `cancel` | `<Esc>`, `q` (normal) | Dismiss without responding (extension sees a cancellation) |

Anything you add under `dialog.keys.<action>` is bound in addition to the built-ins, so you can keep the defaults and just add your preferred shortcuts on top. See [Key specs](keymaps.md#key-specs) for the accepted formats.
