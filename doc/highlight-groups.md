# Highlight groups

All highlight groups are defined with `default = true`, so they can be overridden by your colorscheme or by a later `vim.api.nvim_set_hl` call. Most groups are computed from your base colorscheme at load time (pulling from `Normal`, `Title`, `Function`, `Special`, `Comment`, `WarningMsg`, `DiagnosticError`, `DiagnosticWarn`, `DiagnosticOk`, `CursorLine`, and the diff/gitsigns groups), rather than linking directly to another group. Definitions are (re)applied on `ColorScheme` and `VimEnter`, so switching themes keeps π colors in sync. Run `:hi PiGroupName` at any time to see the current value.
