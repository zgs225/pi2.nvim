# Health & debugging

When something misbehaves — the agent doesn't respond, a tool doesn't render correctly, an extension event doesn't arrive — pi2.nvim gives you a few places to look.

## `:checkhealth pi`

The health check verifies:

- **Neovim version** — 0.10 or newer.
- **The `pi` executable** (from `cli.bin`, defaults to `"pi"`) exists and is in `$PATH`, and its version against the plugin's tracked range:
    - minimum supported: `0.65.2`
    - last validated: `0.79.3`
    - older versions are a hard error; newer versions are reported as unvalidated (warning), not hard-failed.
- **Vision fallback version floor** — when `vision.model` is configured, the check also verifies the pi version against the vision fallback minimum (`0.81.0`): older versions are a hard error, matching versions report OK, and an undetectable pi version is a warning. The floor exists because the bundled vision extension needs `ctx.sessionManager.buildContextEntries()` (pi 0.80.4+) and a public `ModelRegistry.getProvider()` (pi 0.81.0+); 0.81–0.83.x runs through the `provider.streamSimple()` fallback path (validated on 0.83.0), 0.84.0+ uses `ModelRegistry.complete()`. On pi versions below the floor a configured `vision.model` does not crash anything — every image submission fast-fails with a `[pi-vision] …` error notification and the prompt text/attachments are restored. Unset `vision.model` to silence the error without upgrading.
- **Auto-title version floor** — when `title.enabled` is on, the check also verifies the pi version against the auto-title minimum (`0.44.0`) and that the bundled extension (`extensions/title.ts`) is present. Below the floor (or with the file missing) sessions simply stay unnamed and keep the first-message fallback — no crash. Set `title.enabled = false` to silence the error without upgrading.
- **Model-scope bridge check** — always-on: verifies that `extensions/scoped-models.ts` is present (warning if missing) and that the pi version satisfies the bridge minimum (`0.83.0`). Below the floor the bridge stays silent — pi's `--models` / `enabledModels` scope is still honored by `:PiCycleModel` via the backend, but `:PiSelectModel` cannot mirror it and falls back to the configured `models` subset or all models. This severity is a warning rather than an error because without backend scoping the layer is inert anyway; upgrading pi clears it.
- **Treesitter parsers** — `markdown` and `markdown_inline` (info-only; chat highlighting is limited without them).
- **Optional plugins** — `img-clip.nvim` (clipboard image paste), `render-markdown.nvim` (warned when it's the configured engine but missing), `blink.cmp` (info-only).
- **The bundled tree extension** — `extensions/tree.ts` exists when `tree.enabled` is on (`:PiTree` depends on it).
- **Image compression tools** — when `prompt.image_compress` is enabled, at least one of `sips` / `magick` / `ffmpeg` is found (warns if you pinned a specific `tool` that's missing).

Run it any time you suspect something is off with the install:

```vim
:checkhealth pi
```

If the executable isn't found, either install pi or set `cli = { bin = "/absolute/path/to/pi" }` in `setup()`.

## RPC debug logging

pi2.nvim communicates with the backend over a JSONL RPC protocol on the pi process's stdin/stdout. When that conversation goes wrong, the best diagnostic is a transcript of the protocol traffic.

There are two ways to enable it:

- **Statically**, from the start of every session: `debug = true` in `setup()`.
- **At runtime**, toggled on/off without restarting anything: `:PiToggleDebug` / `pi.toggle_debug()`. This override is in-memory only and lasts for the current Neovim session; restart clears it back to whatever `setup()` said.

Logs are written to:

```
<stdpath("log")>/pi/<cwd-slug>/rpc.log
```

where `<cwd-slug>` is the current working directory with `/` replaced by `--`. On a typical Linux setup that's something like `~/.local/state/nvim/log/pi/home--you--Dev--myproject/rpc.log`. The log is **reset** every time debug is enabled, so each session starts with a clean transcript.

The log contains every RPC command pi2.nvim sends and every event it receives, including any unhandled event types (useful when the pi protocol evolves and pi2.nvim hasn't caught up yet). Tailing the file in another terminal while reproducing the bug is usually the fastest way to pinpoint where things diverge:

```sh
tail -f ~/.local/state/nvim/log/pi/*/rpc.log
```

When filing an issue, attaching the relevant section of `rpc.log` is by far the most useful thing you can include.

## Process lifecycle

Each π session owns an underlying `pi --mode rpc` subprocess. One tab = one session = one process. The lifecycle is:

- **Spawned** lazily, the first time you open the chat in a tab (via `:Pi`, `:PiNewTab`, `:PiContinue`, `:PiResume`, `pi.toggle()`, etc.). There is no background daemon; nothing runs until you ask for it.
- **Alive** as long as the tab is alive. Hiding the chat (`:PiToggleChat`) or switching away from the tab does **not** stop the process — the session keeps running in the background, and any queued [attention](attention.md) requests keep being tracked.
- **Torn down** on `TabClosed` for the owning tab, or on `VimLeavePre` for all sessions at once. pi2.nvim sends the appropriate shutdown, waits briefly, and lets the child exit cleanly.
- **Stopped explicitly** via `:PiStop` / `pi.stop()` — kills the RPC process for the current tab's session immediately and closes the chat windows. Use this when you want to reclaim resources without closing the tab, or to force a clean restart (a subsequent `:Pi` will spawn a fresh process).
- **Aborted** via `:PiAbort` / `pi.abort()` — cancels whatever the agent is currently doing mid-turn but keeps the session and process alive, so you can immediately send a new prompt. Different from `:PiStop`: abort stops the _agent_, stop kills the _process_.

## What to check when something's wrong

A rough triage checklist for common symptoms:

| Symptom | First thing to check |
| --- | --- |
| `:Pi` does nothing / reports no executable | `:checkhealth pi` — is `bin` resolvable? |
| Chat opens but never gets a response | Enable debug logging and watch `rpc.log` — are commands going out? Are events coming back? |
| Diff review doesn't open on edit/write | Is a permission extension loaded? See [Diff review](diff-review.md). |
| Extension UI request ignored | Check the extension's `widgetKey` / method — is it something pi2.nvim knows how to route? See [Extensions](extensions.md). |
| Slash command not highlighted | The command cache may not be populated yet (fetched on first chat open, refreshed every 30 seconds). |
| Session doesn't continue with `:PiContinue` | Are you in the same cwd as when the session was started? Sessions are cwd-scoped — see [Sessions](sessions.md). |
| Statusline component shows stale data | The statusline is pushed from RPC events; if they stopped flowing, `rpc.log` will show the gap. |
| Unhandled event warning | pi2.nvim doesn't yet know about a new event type the backend is sending. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/zgs225/pi2.nvim/issues) with the event name and a snippet of `rpc.log`. |
| Prompt paste shows `^[[106;5u` instead of a line break | The terminal pasted Ctrl+J as Kitty CSI-u (or `^[[27;5;106~` / `^[[13;2u`) instead of LF. π rewrites those sequences in the prompt paste handler. Type a newline with `<S-CR>` (or `<C-j>`); `<CR>` still submits. |
| `:PiTree` shows "Failed to decode RPC message: Found too many nested data structures" | The `get_tree` response for a very long session (roughly 500+ messages) is deeper than Neovim's built-in JSON decoder allows. See [Deep RPC payloads](#deep-rpc-payloads) below. |

## Deep RPC payloads

Neovim's `vim.json` (the bundled lua-cjson library) hard-caps JSON nesting at 1000 levels, which cannot be raised at runtime. The pi backend nests the session tree one level **per message**, so `get_tree` responses for long sessions — and with it `:PiTree` — used to fail with `Failed to decode RPC message: Found too many nested data structures (1001) at character N`, and the tree picker never opened.

Since 2026-08-11 pi2.nvim ships its own depth-tolerant JSON decoder (`pi.json`) as a fallback: incoming RPC lines that cjson refuses are re-decoded with it, so `:PiTree` works for sessions up to roughly 4000 messages (the fallback's defensive depth cap). Only when both decoders fail does the warning still appear — normally a sign of a genuinely malformed line; enable [RPC debug logging](#rpc-debug-logging) and check `rpc.log` in that case.
